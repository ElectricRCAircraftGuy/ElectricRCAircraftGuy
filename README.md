# Hi, I'm Gabriel Staples 👋

I'm an Idaho country guy from a small town near Boise. Where I come from, town sizes are measured in the quantity of stop lights we have. Some towns are so small they have zero. My town was a 3 stop light town. Today, it has more. Before that we were in just a 1-blinking-light town. I grew up jumping off cliffs, bridges, and railroad trestles and doing flips off of rope swings into rivers, canals, and reservoirs. For work, I shoveled poo and cleaned cow stalls, dug ditches with a pick, chopped wood, bucked hay, fed cows, irrigated fields with siphon tubes, weeded gardens, and mowed grass.

Now, I live in the San Francisco Bay area and work in San Francisco. I'm trying to balance my life somehow as a husband, father, active Christian, and multi-faceted engineer. When I'm not busy trying to figure out how to better learn my job as a [senior embedded software engineer][linkedin], I'm trying to spend time with my two kids and wife, figure out how to make a Jekyll-based [website so I can write about my thoughts](https://gabrielstaples.com), and spend some time [flying my radio-controlled airplanes][3dhawk] or building or creating something.

I also programmed this gadget and [sell it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computa-Pranksta-Keyboard-Device-50-Settings/dp/B06ZYZ2GTB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwel-20&linkId=d0d2f1c2c4c1ad77d6de98d905f00ce7&language=en_US), and trying to do the business side of things and [handle customer support](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_ComputaPranksta_Support) takes a lot of my spare time.

I am big into RC aircraft and embedded programming. Very fun stuff. I _love_ airplanes and all things that fly! I _love_ building control systems to make autonomous vehicles autonomous. I'm an aeronautical engineer by trade, but I also do a lot with electronics, electrical engineering, and computer science/programming (including a lot with C/C++ in Arduino and some lower-level AVR code). That's how I got my job I have today. Here's my website, with some articles on the aforementioned topics, showing a tiny subset of my work: http://www.ElectricRCAircraftGuy.com. More recently, I created https://gabrielstaples.com to have an avenue to write about anything.

I strive to be a [polyglot](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/polyglot). I have studied both _foreign languages_ and _programming languages_ many thousands of hours.

> I speak English. (Hablo inglés.) (Je parle anglais.) (أنا أتكام الإنجليزية.)  
> Hablo español. (I speak Spanish.) (Je parle espagnol.) (أنا أتكلم الاِسبانية.)  
> Je parle un peu de français. (I speak some French.) (Hablo algo de francés.) (أنا أتكلم بعض الفرنسية.)  
> Eu falo muito pouco de português. (I speak very little Portuguese.)  
> انا اتكلم العربية قليلاً جداً. (I speak Arabic very little.) (Hablo muy poco de árabe.) (Je parle un petit peu l'arabe.)  

I love learning about foreign people, eating foreign foods, and speaking foreign languages. I have put many thousands of hours into foreign language study--just as I have done for aeronautical engineering, electrical engineering, programming, electronics, and controls. I speak Spanish really well and have even helped translate official medical training documents. French is my next best, and is my current area of study. Next comes Portuguese, which I have the least formal training in, but speak next best because it's like a blend of Spanish and French. Lastly, comes Arabic. Although I technically have a minor in it, I'm not conversational in the slightest. Nevertheless, I can read and write it, and I know the alphabet. I have put a great deal of effort into proper pronunciation so I can read and write and make all the sounds.

## Here's one of my favorite projects I've ever done! (Autonomous quadcopter flight controller I wrote myself)

_Quadcopter Physics-based Flight controller demo w/lead point navigation & Arduino interface to RC Tx_. 

See some of the code from an Arduino to the back of an RC Tx (required to duplicate this project yourself) here: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_PPM_Writer.

1. **My Websites** (listed newest first): 
    1. [**GabrielStaples.com**](https://GabrielStaples.com) - my newest and current, anything-I-want Jekyll-based website. Topics I write about here include engineering and programming of course, but I want this to literally be a place I can write about _anything_, so it will also cover some of my thoughts and knowledge on finances and life skills, such as general computer skills, refinancing a house, calculating loan costs, and fixing my bike or phone. It is also where I can write about politics and religion. This is a website that is truly my own. Being a Jekyll site, this also allows me to write in markdown (same as this readme itself), which makes writing less burdensome.
